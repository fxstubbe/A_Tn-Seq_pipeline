# A Tn-Seq pipeline

Transposon sequencing requires the creation of a transposon insertion library, which will contain a group of mutants that collectively have transposon insertions in all non-essential genes. The library is grown under the condition that is of interest. Mutants with transposons inserted in genes required for growth under the test condition will diminish in frequency from the population. To identify genes being lost, sequences encompassing the transposon ends are amplified by PCR and sequenced to determine the location and abundance of each insertion mutation.

## Read Alignment

To determine the location and abundance of each transposon insertion, short sequencing reads are mapped to a reference genome. This allows to identify the 'correct' genomic loci from which the read originated. 

### Make a Genomic Index

Read alignment by BWA uses an FM-index (Full-text index in Minute space) of the reference genome. Both single and paired read libraries are supported. The bwtsw algorithm should be used for short (<100bp) sequencing reads. 

```
bwa index  [-p prefix] [-a algoType] <genome.fasta>
```

Arguments : 

- `-p` (STR) : Prefix of the output database (same as database file name)
- `-a`(STR) : Algorithm for constructing BWT index. Are available **is** and **bwtsw** (recommemded)
- `<genome.fasta>` : Reference genome 

### Genome Alignment

The BWA-MEM algorithm performs local alignment. It may produce multiple primary alignments for different part of a query sequence. This is a crucial feature for long sequences. However, some tools such as Picardâ€™s markDuplicates does not work with split alignments. One may consider to use option -M to flag shorter split hits as secondary

**Single-end**

```
bwa mem [-t nThreads] <db.prefix> <reads.fq> > <output.sam>
```

**Paired-end**

```
bwa mem [-t nThreads] <db.prefix> <reads_F1.fq> <reads_F2.fq> > <output.sam>
```

Arguments : 

- `-t` (INT) : Number of threads
- `<db.prefix>` : Index database outputed at the previous step (**Make a Genomic Index**) 
- `<Reads.fq>` : Sequencing Reads (F1, F2 if paired-end)
- `<output.sam>` : Name of the output alignment file (ex: L001_R2.sam) 

For additionnal informations, see [BWA Manual][bwa_manual].

### Location and Abundance of transposon insertions 

**Sort SAM files**

Sort alignments by leftmost coordinates 

```
samtools sort [-@ nThreads] [-o Output file] <input.sam>
```

Arguments : 

- `-@` (INT) : Number of threads
- `-o` (STR) : Name of the output (ex: L001_sorted_R2.bam)
- `<input.sam>` : SAM file to sort (Generated at the previous step **Genome Alignment**)


**Merge BAM files**

Merge aligned (**same** genome) and sorted reads into a single alignment file

```
samtools merge [-@ nThreads] [-b list.txt] <output.bam>
```

Arguments : 

- `-@` (INT) : Number of threads
- `-b` (FILE) : List containing path to the sorted BAM files to merge
- `<onput.sam>` : Name of the output BAM file (ex: L001_merged.bam)


**Get coverage**

```
samtools depth [-a] [-f merged_file.bam] [-o <FILE.txt>]
```

Arguments : 
- `-a` : Output all positions (including those with zero depth)
- `-f` (FILE) : Use the BAM files specified in the FILE (a file of filenames, one file per line)
- `-o` (STR) : Name of the output file (ex: L001_coverage.txt)

Exemple of Output table : 

Chromosome      | Coordinates                        | Coverage
---            | ---                            | ---
I          | 1                     |  0
I          | 2                    |  0
I          | 3                    |  117

II          | 1918                    |  98

## The sliding window strategy

### Convert annotation (.gff) to a readble table

**Script** : gff_converter.R


### Compute an essentiallity index

To assess for essentiality of a gene, a sliding window we used a sliding window approach. Instead of counting insertions in genes, we count insertions in overlapping windows of a fixed size.

**Script** : TN_Seq02_sliding_window.R

**User defimed parameters**  

- `rWindow` : Sized of the sliding window
- `rSliding` : Sliding window shift

**Method** 

1) The coverage file and the converted GFF files are loaded into R.  

2) The coverage file is splitted into chromosomes, which are processed individually.

3) The coverage file is split into coordinates windows matching the `rWindow` and `rSliding` parameters. For exemple, with a rWindow of 200 and a rsliding of 5, a genome of length 3 278 307 bp is into 655,662 windows. 

4) For each window the sum of aligned reads (coverage) is computed. The logarithm in base 10 is computed for the sum.

5) Each annotated gene in the converted GFF file is assigned an essentiallity index. The index corresponds to the number of empty (0 insertion) window overlaping (even by 1 nt) the annotated gene. If there are no empty window overlapping a given gene (essentiallity index = 0), the gene is skipped.

6) For each chromosome, a file containing a list of potentially essential genes (essentiallity index > 0) is created

### Make graphs

**Script** : TN_Seq02_sliding_window.R

The script requires the coverage file and the list of potentially essential genes

**User defimed parameters**  

- `boundaries` : Number of nucleotides to represent in the upstream and downstream region of a given gene
- `S_factor` : Smoothing factor (size of average positions to plot) 
- `rWindow` : Size of window used to generate the list (used to read the good set of files)
