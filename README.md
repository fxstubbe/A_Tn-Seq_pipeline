# A Tn-Seq pipeline

## 1) Getting the reference

Firstly, you need to retrieve your genome of interest and its annotation file

```
bwa index -a bwtsw <genome.fasta>
```

### Convert GFF to human readable table

### Make a genome index

### BAM generation using SamTools

### Get coverage by nt and export in .txt format

### Find essential genes using a sliding window strategy

### Graph generation for essential genes
